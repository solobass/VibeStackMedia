# Prevent Vercel from deploying this branch
# Keep the "Coming Soon" page live until ready to launch
#
# NOTE: .vercelignore doesn't prevent deployments.
# To prevent auto-deployment:
# 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
# 2. Disable "Auto-deploy" for the main branch
# OR
# 3. Go to Deployments → Click the three dots on latest deployment → "Ignore Build Step"
#    Then add a condition that always returns false (e.g., "exit 1")
#
# The "Coming Soon" page is still live at www.vibestackmedia.com
